**Map topsoil phosphorus content**

For the initialization of the soil nutrient content the SWAT+ model requires the labile phosphorus (P) content of the surface layer. Measured soil P content is often not available for most of the catchment areas. However it is an important input data to analyse the nutrient retention. As the [LUCAS Topsoil Survey dataset](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/lucas) (Tóth et al., 2013, Jones et al. 2015) contains measured Olsen-P content data of about 20.000 soil samples in Europe, it can be used to derive approximate maps of soil P content for data scarce areas. This simple method can be applied to produce Olsen-P maps for any European catchments for which the LUCAS Topsoil dataset is relevant. Further required data are the [LUCAS Land Use / Cover Area Frame Survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/lucas/data/primary-data), [European agro-climate zone map](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/observed-climate-zones-in-the) and the land use or land cover map of the target area. If national data on soil P content is available, that could be used further to or instead of the LUCAS Topsoil Survey dataset, after transforming the values into Olsen-P content.
